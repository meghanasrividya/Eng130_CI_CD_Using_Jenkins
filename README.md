Continuous_Integration and Continous_Delivery/Continuous_Deployement using Jenkins
### What is Continuous Integration?
-Continuous Integrationis the practice of automating the build and testing of code every time a change is made — and committing that code back to a central repository.
### What is Continuos Delivery?
-Continuous Delivery is an extension of continuous integration to make sure that you can release new changes to your customers quickly in a sustainable way. This means that on top of having automated your testing, you also have automated your release process and you can deploy your application at any point of time by clicking on a button. In continuous Delivery the deployment is completed manually.
### What is the differnce between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?
- Simply put, CI is the process of integrating code into a mainline code base. In almost all scenarios today, CI is done using platforms designed specifically for the purpose. Implementing CI is, therefore, as simple as using the right tools.

- CD is more complicated. CD is about the processes that have to happen after code is integrated for app changes to be delivered to users. Those processes involving testing, staging and deploying code. There is no single type of tool that does all these things. These processes take different forms, depending on the culture of the team and the type of app it is creating.

- In actuality, then, CI and CD share little in common. Besides starting with the same word (“continuous”) and being different stages in modern software delivery pipelines, they don’t have much to do with one another.

### What are Webhooks?
- Webhooks allow interaction between web-based applications through the use of custom callbacks. The use of webhooks allows web applications to automatically communicate with other web-apps. Unlike traditional systems where one system (subject) keeps polling another system (observer) for some data, Webhooks allow the observer to push data into the subject’s system automatically whenever some event occurs.
- This eliminates the need for constant checking to be done by the subject.
